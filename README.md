# VisualiseR
VR application for different scenarios as code review, presentation or showroom.
Developed with Unity for Google Cardboard.


## Presentation
The user is placed into an realistic presentation room and can conduct a presentation. Firstly, the user needs to choose his slides on his mobile device. 
Then he is placed into the room behind an lectern where his slides are placed (see figure 1). In front of him is the grand stand, where other users which join the presentation are placed (see figure 2). He can navigate though the slides, can use a laser pointer or can show all his slides (see figure 3).

## Code Review
Firstly, the user needs to choose his code fragment.
Then he is placed into the room.
In Front is the current code fragment (see figure 4).
He can rate this code fragment in 3 categories (Uncritical, Minor, Major) by choosing the button "Rate" in the menu.
Furthermore he can edit the code fragment by adding a comment.
To the right are the upcoming code framgents (see figure 5).
To the left are informations about the current code fragment (see figure 6).

## Showroom
The user is placed into an empty world.
He can add objects (cube, sphere etc.), can edit them (move, rotate and color) and take photos.
Furthermore he can walk freely in the world.
